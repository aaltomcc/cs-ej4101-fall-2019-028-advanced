The name is Anton Puolakka and in the professional world I am a digital strategist who can and has to deal with issues related to ISO OSI layers ranging from 3 to 8.

The current domain in which I am applying my skills in is electric boating. The expected impact is no less than to revolutionarize how free-time recreational boating shall be felt.

In historical context I have experienced a technologial journey with some true evolution: decades ago I needed to set up an endless cluster of raw socket options to get me connected right while quite recently the maturity has reached a level that I can set up a working web server with one single line of code. You've got it right: my primary angle to issues is a software engineering one.

While I started my career as a deep subject-matter expert I did not want to stick to that particular role alone: in the later years I've repeatedly lead international teams and I've been part of the team that negotiated an eight-figure managed services deal.

Programming is like bicycling: once you get it, it sticks with you. And you love it!
