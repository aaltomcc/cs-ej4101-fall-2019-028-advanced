Yes, I am open for business.

The last few years I've been involved with many IoT projects. Not super-small-scale embedded but reasonably powerful devices that can do a variety of tricks. Combined with cloud tools we see the value, a non-trivial value indeed.

Python 3, JavaScript/Node, Java 2 SE and last but not least: C++/STL. Experienced data modeler and DB administrator. Non-relational? Redis isn nice. For IoT the of the breed is Balena, just got to love it!

Docker, Travis CI, Hugo skins and wiki documenting (TWiki admin), many many many SCM tools, incl. git. I've created a few PKI / Certificate Authorities so OpenSSL and cumbersome format conversions and fail-safe authority hierarchies are just alright with me. 

Linux: RedHat, Ubuntu and BusyBox distros and mostly bash.

IoT: CAN bus, flashing, reading hex with joy. The biggest super-power of mine is experience with such many end-to-end systems, from sensor to insight.

Back-end person, team player and cross-function diplomat, agile (ScrumMaster certified).

What not. As you can see.
