<p>The name is Anton Puolakka and in the professional world I am a digital strategist who can and has to deal with issues related to ISO OSI layers ranging from 3 to 8.</p>
<p>The domain in which I am applying my skills in is electric boating and the expected impact is no less than to revolutionarize the experience of free-time recreational boating.</p>
<p>In historical context I have experienced a technologial journey where decades ago I needed to set up an endless cluster raw socket options to get me connected right to the current situation in which I can set up a working web server with one single line of code. That's right: my primary angle to issues is software engineering one.</p>
<p>While I started my career as a deep subject-matter expert I did not want to stick to that role alone: in the later years I've repeatedly lead international teams and I've been part of the team that negotiated an 8 figure managed services deal.</p>
<p>Programming is like bicycling: once you get it, it sticks with you. And you love it!</p>
