      <description>My blog
About The name is Anton Puolakka and in the professional world I am a digital strategist who can and has to deal with issues related to ISO OSI layers ranging from 3 to 8.
The domain in which I am applying my skills in is electric boating and the expected impact is no less than to revolutionarize the experience of free-time recreational boating.
In historical context I have experienced a technologial journey where decades ago I needed to set up an endless cluster raw socket options to get me connected right to the current situation in which I can set up a working web server with one single line of code.</description>
