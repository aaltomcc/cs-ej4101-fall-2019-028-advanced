      <description>This Course 028 Learned about FiTech somewhere early September 2019 and happily started to cherry-pick courses from various universities including Aalto.
While I&#39;ve been professionally involved with software engineering for more than a quarter of a century I&#39;ve seen the gradual change in the software realization process. I must admit Scrum made a bigger impact than any other system and not least because I was trained to the drill by people who participated writing Agile Manifesto and defining the Scrum process.</description>

      <description>The name is Anton Puolakka and in the professional world I am a digital strategist who can and has to deal with issues related to ISO OSI layers ranging from 3 to 8.
The current domain in which I am applying my skills in is electric boating. The expected impact is no less than to revolutionarize how free-time recreational boating shall be felt.
In historical context I have experienced a technologial journey with some true evolution: decades ago I needed to set up an endless cluster of raw socket options to get me connected right while quite recently the maturity has reached a level that I can set up a working web server with one single line of code.</description>
