Learned
=======
* That Aalto takes it easy with deadlined and project deliverables while imposing super-strict deadline policy on the students.
* Some deep git stuff (that I do not remember but I have a hint that it exists now)
* That the videos talk about waterfall style in such a way that it's value is not well understood (V model is good and justified, guys, but not necessarily on your ecommerce site!)


Most Challenging Part
=====================
As the instructions for the starter course talked in general manner about pusblishing through GitHub pages it was only after advanced course instrcutions indirectly told me that GitHub Pages is a publishing tool. With this tiny little hint I got my page published. A big difference whether it is 'GitHub pages' or 'GitHub Pages' in the instructions.

2nd place goes to GitHub portal the logic of which is far from my routine understanding. I get things done but I am not exactly sure when and how all the merge requests and pull requests come from (as options to be chosen by the portal user). However, by the end of the course I am pretty sure this is a minor detail. [I'm a GitLab user and this was somehow never an issue there.]


Next Steps
==========
Something I'd really would like to know about is being a GitHub admin for a very busy project. And not only to keep all the incoming requests straight but to cherry-pick and do some other big decisions that are not aligned with all the intentios of all the contributors. I am happy this is not part of the course as I expect that kind of a job to be so tedious that I'd rather see me getting some wage for that kind of stuff.

Docker stuff... where was that? Hopefully there is some steps with that in the advanced project. Yes, it is only very sexy a version of Make but it seems to be so ubiqitous nowadays that intermediate skills on it start to be elementary. For pretty much everything, even outside the traditional software engineering.


Course Overall Feeling
======================
I'd be happy to do more courses like this. The total support for online is a good thing.
