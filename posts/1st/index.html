<p>Learned about FiTech somewhere early September 2019 and happily started to cherry-pick courses from various universities including Aalto.</p>
<p>While I've been professionally involved with software engineering for more than a quarter of a century I've seen the gradual change in the software realization process. I must admit Scrum made a bigger impact than any other system and not least because I was trained to the drill by people who participated writing Agile Manifesto and defining the Scrum process. Best of the breed.</p>
<p>DevOps I considerd to be a variation of agile and a gradual change from agile world into something more agile. Or maybe something that got formalized from the practises executed in wise organizations. To put it bluntly, I believe the management sales argument or the hidden agenda is to save cost and minimize the testing phase (and testing team especially) in the software process.</p>
<p>I admit my above mentioned viewpoint before the course might have not been exactly complete and possibly reflected somewhat pessimistic viewpoint, too. So, as there was a course related to devOps in FiTech selection I happily enrolled.</p>
<p>I did not expect to see much new nor that the course would be too challenging to me. And I was right. Yet the amount of information and vast resources are surely something I value a lot. Of course I can git myself around but the amount of git wizardry available through the course material is impressive. Surely this is valuable.</p>
<p>So, simply put:</p>
<ul>
<li>prime oneself on tech issues and high-level theory related to devOps</li>
<li>correct the vocabulary (to be able to communicate effectively with nerds)</li>
<li>get in touch with resources that have the details unkown earlier</li>
<li>deepen the insight</li>
<li>do a nice exercise</li>
<li>achieve an official approval / medal of your skills</li>
</ul>
